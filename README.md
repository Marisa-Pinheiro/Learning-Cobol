# COBOL Learning Repository

Welcome to my COBOL Learning Repository! This is where I document my journey as I delve into the world of COBOL programming.

## About COBOL

COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) is a high-level programming language primarily designed for business, finance, and administrative systems. Despite being developed in the late 1950s, COBOL remains relevant today, powering critical systems in various industries.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **Code Samples:**
   Explore the `code_samples` directory to find snippets and small programs written in COBOL. These samples reflect my learning progress and experiments with different aspects of the language.

### 2. **Projects:**
   In the `projects` directory, you'll find more comprehensive COBOL projects that I'm working on. These may include exercises, small applications, or projects inspired by real-world scenarios.

### 3. **Learning Resources:**
   Check out the `learning_resources` directory for documentation, tutorials, and any helpful resources I've come across during my COBOL learning journey. Feel free to suggest additional resources through issues or pull requests.


## Getting Started

If you're new to COBOL or want to follow along with my learning process, you can start by:

1. **Cloning the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Marisa-Pinheiro/Learning-Cobol.git
   cd Learning-Cobol
   ```

2. **Exploring the Code:**
Take a look at the code samples and projects in the respective directories. Feel free to run, modify, and experiment with the code.

3. **Contributing:**
If you have insights, suggestions, or corrections, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request. Learning is a collaborative process, and I welcome any contributions that can enhance the quality of this repository.
